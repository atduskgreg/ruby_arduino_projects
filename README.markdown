Hello from git post-commit hook.

<h2>Git Bell</h2>

[13 February 2009]

RAD script and desktop client code for making a bell ring when you commit code with git. Includes an example post-commit hook script using the client code to ring the bell. Client code sends a serial message for which the Dorkboard is listening. Dorkboard used because of its fast startup time. See <a href="http://ozmm.org/posts/git_post_commit_for_profit.html">Defunkt's guide to post-commit hooks</a> for details on the git mechanism.

<h2>Dorkboard Test</h2>

[8 February 2009]

Serial hello world with Dorkboard. Includes config/hardware.yml with the right settings for Dorkboard (for my OS X machine, at least). Dorkboard is a local Portland homegrown freeduino. It is notable for its incredibly tiny form factor and its super fast startup time. <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/dorkboard">More about the Dorkboard</a>.
